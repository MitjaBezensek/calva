# Calva Sponsors

Calva is open source and free to use. It is actively maintained during our free time, and it keeps improving. You can contribute in many different ways, one of which is sponsoring. These are our sponsor profiles:

* [Peter Str√∂mberg](https://github.com/sponsors/PEZ)
* [Brandon Ringe](https://github.com/sponsors/bpringe)

There you can see who are sponsoring Calva, and this is also displayed in the [README](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva#calva-sponsors-%EF%B8%8F) of the Calva project (which means it is also displayed in the [VS Code Extension Marketlace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva#calva-sponsors)).

If you are working at a company which benefits from Calva's existence and continued development, please consider sponsoring at the Calva Gold Sponsor tier. 

Please see [this statement from Cognitect](https://cognitect.com/blog/2020/12/15/sponsoring-open-source-developers) about the importance of supporting open source developers.
